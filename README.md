# SkalaNet
A simple neural network for classifying handwritten digits, implemented in Scala 3. It is inspired by the excellent introductory series by 3b1b and the equally great book by Michael Nielsen. Links to both resources can be found in the links-section further below. 

# Scala Native
This project was originally going to be implemented in Scala Native but for some reason the Native-compiler breaks the correctness of the code so I will be using plain Scala 3 for the time being.
